Hello and welcome. 

Tools that I use on a daily basis as a software developer. They can make your job easier too.

__Work in progress__

## on-line

### WebSequenceDiagrams

Whiteboard, but better: Ideal for quickly creating linkage diagrams, flow diagrams, etc. Everything is text based, so diagrams are very easy to edit.

### Asana

For task management. I also use tasks not related to professional work.

## standalone

### Notepad++

### Everything

[Eveything Home Page](https://www.voidtools.com/)

### Cmder
